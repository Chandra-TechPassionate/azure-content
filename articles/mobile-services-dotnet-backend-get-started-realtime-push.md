When complete, your application will sync to-do item list whenever record is inserted.

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable realtime push:

1. [Update the server to host SignalR Hub](#update-server)
2. [Update the app to listen messages from server](#update-app)

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service.
